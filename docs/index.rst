The ASK SDK for Java makes it easier for you to build highly engaging
skills, by allowing you to spend more time on implementing features and
less on writing boiler-plate code.

To help you get started more with the SDK we have included several
samples, references, and guides. We’ve collected links to all of them
here to make them easy to find, as well as a description for what each
document covers.
